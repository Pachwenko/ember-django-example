# ember-django-example
Example frontend and backend using Ember.js, Python and Django

This is supposed to be a simple application to demonstrate a full stack web application using Ember.js with Python + Django. It is based upon the [official ember tutorial](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/part-1/).

The frontent connects to the backend using [Ember Data's JSONAPI](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/models/customizing-adapters/).

For more info see the README for the [frontend](frontend/README.md) or [backend](backend/README).
